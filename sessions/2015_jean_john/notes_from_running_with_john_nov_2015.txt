windows vs linux - file association vs #!/usr/bin/ruby
talked about defining operators
duck typing - you mean actual literal typing on a keyboard?
duck slide broken
	need Duck.new, not just Duck in def game
	(self) on class methods is no good
string interpolation
single and double quotes experimentation
division (when it's a float, when it's an int)
naming in ruby (this came about looking for PI and talking about why it was Math::PI)
	classes are CamelCase
	methods are xnake_case
	constants are PHTEPHEN_CASE
symbols typical use (I had trouble splaining about symbols.)
	directions = [:north, :south, :east, :west] # enum
	if directions.includes?(current_direction)
	{:a => "bob"} # keys
	"a".send(:reverse) # I expect this thing to exist
symbols => faster than strings
first 40 slides - 1.5 hours
discussion about pass by reference vs copy (I had trouble splaining about this)
